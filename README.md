# project-01
Repository for our first project

#Description
This is a very short quiz for helping with the US citizenship test.  Here are the things it can do:
  -Load questions
  -Use a radio button to get users input
  -Tell you if you are correct or incorrect
  -tally your score
  -end the quiz

#Technology
  This uses javascript to load questions, inform users if they are correct or incorrect, and tally the score.  The HTML is used to provide a box for the game to be hosted in, and the CSS is used to provide style to the quiz.

#User Stories
As a user:
  1. Should be able to start the game.
  2. Answer a question, and recieve immediate feedback.
  3. Realize which answer I got wrong.
  4. When I click next, see the next question.
  5. See my score at the end of the quiz.

#Future Upgrades

I want to continue building on this project to include the following:
  -Have the entire test for the US citizenship test
  -Be able to get location to load up answers for local questions (i.e Who is your congressman/senator?)


I took the approach of choosing something simple because my javascript is very weak at the moment, and it is evident in my script file.  I used very basic approaches by coding simple functions throughout, mixed with if/else loops. I also took a lot of inspiration from other quizzes online and getting professional help from Reddit. I hope my Javascript knowledge will grow into something more formidable in the future because I know of how important it is for the Web Development world. Right now it is very simple, but very functional.
