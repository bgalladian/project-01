#Description
This is a very short quiz for helping with the US citizenship test.  Here are the things it can do:
  1.Load questions
  2.Use a radio button to get users input
  3.Tell you if you are correct or incorrect
  4.Tally your score
  5.End the quiz

#Technology
  This uses javascript to load questions, inform users if they are correct or incorrect, and tally the score.  The HTML is used to provide a box for the game to be hosted in, and the CSS is used to provide style to the quiz.

#User Stories
As a user:
  1. Should be able to start the game.
  2. Answer a question, and recieve immediate feedback.
  3. Realize which answer I got wrong.
  4. When I click next, see the next question.
  5. See my score at the end of the quiz.

#Future Upgrades

I want to continue building on this project to include the following:
  1. Have the entire test for the US citizenship test
  2. Be able to get location to load up answers for local questions (i.e Who is your congressman/senator?)

Good readme, contains all relevant parts and gives solid evidence of planning. However, in the conclusion below, take out the parts about your javascript being weak at the moment. Your code is actually quite solid
for a beginner. Leave the parts about where you got inspiration and examples from. Overall great job man. 

I took the approach of choosing something simple because my javascript is very weak at the moment, and it is evident in my script file.  I used very basic approaches by coding simple functions throughout, mixed with if/else loops. I also took a lot of inspiration from other quizzes online and getting professional help from Reddit. I hope my Javascript knowledge will grow into something more formidable in the future because I know of how important it is for the Web Development world. Right now it is very simple, but very functional.
