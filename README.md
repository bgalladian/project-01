Repository for our first project

This is a very short quiz for helping with the US citizenship test.  Here are the things it can do:
  -Load questions
  -Use a radio button to get users input
  -Tell you if you are correct or incorrect
  -tally your score
  -end the quiz

I want to continue building on this project to include the following:
  -Have the entire test for the US citizenship test
  -Be able to get location to load up answers for local questions (i.e Who is your congressman/senator?)


I took the approach of choosing something simple because my javascript is very weak at the moment, and it is evident in my script file.  I used very basic approaches by coding simple functions throughout, mixed with if/else loops. I also took a lot of inspiration from other quizzes online and getting professional help from Reddit. I hope my Javascript knowledge will grow into something more formidable in the future because I know of how important it is for the Web Development world.
