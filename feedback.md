 ## Code Comments:

 Take a look at my inline code comments in the pull request for specific notes on code.

 ## Deployment:

 > Did you successfully deploy your project to github pages? Is the app's functionality the same deployed as it is locally?

 **2: Performing.** Both the deployed app and local version are running smoothly.

 ## Technical Requirements:

 > Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

 **2: Performing.** The project met the requirements well. I was definitely impressed with how smoothly your project functioned. I would recommend going back and adding features now such as an ability to restart the game or shuffling the order of questions. For the desired feature of location based questions, you would need to use some sort of geolocation (HTML5 has this built) and some sort of API to query about congressional districts (we will learn about these in the weeks ahead)

 ## Code Quality:

 > Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code?

 **2: Performing.** Your code is neat, well-organized and has semantic naming conventions. There are a few opportunities for refactoring, but overall great job. (see comments in code)

 ## Creativity/Interface:

 > Is your user interface easy to use and understand? Does it make sense for the problem you're solving? Does your interface demonstrate creative design?

 **2: Performing.** Good interface. I like how the quiz transitions smoothly from question to question. Could be improved by have 'right' / 'wrong' printed to the dom somewhere (like in a notification div) instead of via alerts.
